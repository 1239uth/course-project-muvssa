## Fitness Tracker with Social Media

FitApp is an android app that will serve as a fitness tracker with a social media
component for fitness enthusiasts who want to monitor and share their fitness experience.


### NOTE when building (Only if using IntelliJ to run app)

Intellij may not automatically generate the `local.properties` file, which is required to run the program.

After cloning the repository, create a file called `local.properties` and put it right under
the main module. Inside it, only one line is required, referencing your local location to the Android sdk.

##### For Mac Users:
copy `sdk.dir=/Users/<YOUR_MAC_USERNAME_HERE>/Library/Android/sdk`

##### For Windows Users:
copy `sdk.dir=C\:\\Users\\<YOUR_WINDOWS_USERNAME_HERE>\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk`

Here is an image demonstrating what the file would look like for a **Windows User**
