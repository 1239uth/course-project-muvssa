## Fitness Tracker with Social Media

We want to develop an android app that will serve as a fitness tracker with a social media
component for fitness enthusiasts who want to monitor and share their fitness experience.

To run this program, locate the main method in `FitApp.java`.


NOTICE IF THE YOU CANT RUN THIS
Intellij does not automatically generate local.properties file, this is required to run the program

It looks like this.
So if android sutdio does not automatically make it, either drag one in, or create it your self.
