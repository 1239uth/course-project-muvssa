## Fitness Tracker with Social Media

We want to develop an android app that will serve as a fitness tracker with a social media 
component for fitness enthusiasts who want to monitor and share their fitness experience.

##### Introduction

The app is for users who are seeking additional help with enhancing their wellness by allowing
us to track their healthy lifestyle and workoutTemplate routines. The users will be able to follow 
training regimens and keep a note of their everyday accomplishments. The app will be merged
with social media aspects, where the users will not only be able to track their own progress,
but also follow other users and get new ideas for their own workoutTemplate regime. Furthermore, the
app will come with numerous types of exerciseTemplates including (but not limited to) weighted, 
cardio, and calisthenics exerciseTemplates. The app will also provide the user with useful statistics
such as their average duration of a workoutTemplate, their linear progression (such as volume, one-rep
max, personal records) so that they can compare their progress with other users. 


##### Usage Breakdown

1. Users of the app will be required to create a profile to begin using the app. 
They will need to provide their full name, a desired username, and their desired password.


2. Once a profile is created, the user will have the ability to create a workoutTemplate by selecting
a collection of exerciseTemplates. If the desired exerciseTemplate is not available, the user will be able 
to create that exerciseTemplate.


3. The users will also be able to create a routine, which is a collection of workoutTemplates.
A routine will allow the user to organize their workoutTemplates and group them.


4. Optionally, the user will be able to create a weekly schedule for their workoutTemplates.


5. Once all the workoutTemplates and routines are set up, the user can start their workoutTemplate whenever
they want. The workoutTemplate screen will then be displayed, where the user can track their sets, 
reps, weight or time.

   
6. When the user has finished the workoutTemplate, they can end the workoutTemplate which will then 
publish this workoutTemplate on their profile as a post. Other users will be able to comment and 
like this post.


7. Additionally, the users will have a feed where they will see posts from the users they
decide to follow. They can also like and comment on these posts. To find other users and 
view their profiles, the user can search them by their username. The app will also suggest
other users to them.
